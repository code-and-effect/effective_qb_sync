      %strong Resolution steps:

    %ol
      - if @error.include?('invalid reference to QuickBooks Item')
        %li Confirm the QuickBooks Item Names for this Order within QuickBooks
        %li Visit the website administration
        %li Visit the Orders screen, find the order, and click the 'QB Item Names'
        %li Update each order item with a correct Item Name
        %li Update the Product (Event, Membership Type, Product, etc.) with the correct Item Name
        %li Re-run the QuickBooks Sync

      - elsif @error.include?('the list element is already in use')
        %li This customer could not be created because they share a name with an existing Item Name. This could be as a Vendor, Product, or Service.
        %li Search QuickBooks for the non-customer item name and rename it. Ex: rename "John Doe" to "John Doe (Vendor)"
        %li Re-run the QuickBooks Sync

      - elsif @error.include?('cannot use the same tax item')
        %li QuickBooks has been configured to automatically add GST for this item, but the order already contains a GST line item
        %li Edit the item in QuickBooks and uncheck the inclusion of GST
        %li Re-run the QuickBooks Sync

      - else
        %li This is an error without a predefined resolution. Please wait for AgileStyle to follow up with you.
